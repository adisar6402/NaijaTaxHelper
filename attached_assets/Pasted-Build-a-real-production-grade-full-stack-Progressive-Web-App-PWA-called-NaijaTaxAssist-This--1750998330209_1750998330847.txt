Build a real, production-grade full-stack Progressive Web App (PWA) called **NaijaTaxAssist**. This app helps Nigerians understand and access the new 2025 tax reforms through tools like tax relief checkers, PDF letter generators, and VAT-free item guidance. It must be functional, polished, and free to use — built using zero-cost tools only.

🔹 MAIN GOAL:
Make tax reforms understandable and actionable to everyday Nigerians: low-income earners, remote workers, landlords, SMEs.

---

🔧 TECH STACK (Zero-Cost Only):
* **Frontend:** React + Tailwind CSS (UI polish is critical)
* **Backend:** Flask (Python) or Node.js (if easier)
* **PDF:** html2pdf.js or jsPDF (for downloadable letters)
* **Database:** JSON files or SQLite (for static data like VAT-free items)
* **Deployment:** Netlify (frontend), Replit Flask server (backend)
* **PWA:** Service Worker + manifest.json for offline install support

🧩 FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT:

1. ✅ **Eligibility Checker**  
   - User inputs: income, rent, job type, remote work status  
   - Returns: exemption status for PAYE, stamp duty, VAT  
   - Logic example: income ≤ ₦1,000,000/year → exempt from PAYE

2. 🧾 **Downloadable PDF Letter Generator**  
   - Generates formal exemption letters based on user's data  
   - Options: for employer (PAYE), for landlord (stamp duty exemption)  
   - Make it downloadable instantly (use html2pdf.js)

3. 📊 **PAYE Savings Calculator**  
   - User inputs monthly salary  
   - Output: total tax savings yearly  
   - Example: ₦120,000 saved/year if below threshold

4. 🛒 **VAT-Free Items List**  
   - Display searchable, categorized list of exempted items  
   - Categories: Food, Baby Items, Education, Electricity, Healthcare

5. 🌍 **Remote Worker/Digital Nomad Guide**  
   - Static page with simplified tax tips for freelancers & tech workers  
   - Localized to Nigeria (mention Dollar earners, BVN, etc.)

6. 📲 **Installable PWA Support**  
   - App manifest.json  
   - Offline access and “Add to Home Screen” support  
   - Optimized for mobile-first experience

7. 🖥️ **Admin Dashboard (Optional)**  
   - Show anonymous usage stats (number of users, exemptions checked, letters generated)

* Clear navigation bar with logo & pages
* Mobile-first responsive layout
* Smooth animations and transitions
* Add icons to buttons: e.g., download, check, info

📌 Example Navigation:
* Home
* Eligibility Checker
* PAYE Calculator
* Download Tax Letter

📦 DATA TO EMBED:
* PAYE exemption threshold: ₦1,000,000/year
* Stamp duty threshold: ₦10,000,000/year rent
* VAT-free items list (embed a static JSON)
* Tax letter templates (basic HTML with placeholders)

---

🧠 AFTER YOU BUILD IT, PLEASE ALSO:

* 💄 Polish the UI with Tailwind themes and smooth UX
* 💾 Make the PDF letter feature fully downloadable
* 🔌 Connect frontend inputs to backend logic properly
* 🧪 Help me test all features live (in-browser, no login required)
* 📱 Ensure PWA support is working across devices

This is a real app, not a demo. It must work, look professional, and be impressive enough to pitch to Nigerian government officials (FIRS, Ministry of Finance, PEBEC).

Make the full code modular and clean. All code should run on free tier of Replit or exportable to Netlify + backend.
